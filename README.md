# Optimization Fall 2024 Class Code

The following is a collection of code written for assignments for a semester long class in optimization at UAF. The class was taught in the math department by Ed Bueler. The code was not updated after grading, so use at your own risk if you are taking the class during a different semester. The class culiminated in a class project, which is inside a folder called capstone.

## Capstone Class Project

For the class project, a reduced Newton method with active set constraints was applied. The project was an optimization scheme for properly allocating power fluid to jet pump assisted wells.
