The following is collection of the code written for assignments for a semester long class in optimization at UAF. The class was taught in the math department by Ed Bueler. The majority is the code submitted for individual assignments. The code has not been updated after grading, so it is recommended to use at your own risk if you are taking the same class offered during a different semester. The class culiminated in a class project, which is is inside a folder called capstone.
